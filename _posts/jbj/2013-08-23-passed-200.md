I can proudly announce that jbj has eventually surpassed the "200 successfull tests" mark and thereby closed the gap to the real thing by a good margin.

As you might have noticed, the aim of jbj is to incorporate the testsuite of the PHP-interpreter itself. More Details can be found here: [Core tests]({{ BASE_PATH }}/projects/jbj/core_tests.html)
