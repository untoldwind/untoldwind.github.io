jbj has eventually passed the "700 successful testcases" marks.

Though, this is mostly due to the fact that it now also incorporates the testsuite of the Zend-Engine itself, which increased the overall number of "tests to be transfered" by a significant amount. Apart from the obvious reason "most tests is always better", it primarily stared because the PHP core tests do not cover some features of the more modern PHP interpreter.

A short summary of the overall state can now be found [here]({{ BASE_PATH }}/projects/jbj.html).

The good news is, that jbj now supports heredoc, nowdoc, namespaces and closures. Even crazy stuff like this is working as intended:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$a = function(&$a) { $a = 1; };

$a($a);

?>
{% endhighlight %}

... I really like this little one.

BTW: The intended behavior is to throw a fatal error ... obviously ... right?
