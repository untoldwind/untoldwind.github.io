Just recently jbj was introduced at the [BED-Con 2014](http://bed-con.org). All the details of the talk have been assembled [here](http://leanovate.github.io/bedcon/). 

Even though jbj was the primary topic of the talk, some aspects about writing parsers in scala or how to use scala macros to generate glue code on compile time might be of some interest to some other projects as well. Therefore I started a companion [project](https://github.com/leanovate/bedcon) conataining some "simple" examples that might help you getting up to speed.
