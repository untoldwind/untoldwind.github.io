Recently I was asked why jbj - being not so much about java any more - is a Maven project instead of an SBT project. Simplest answer is: Convenience. That and the fact that I was not able to create an SBT project in Idea I felt comfortable with.

Let me formulate my experiences with the Intelli/J scala plugin in form of a short limerick:

... hmmm, ok, maybe I should leave the poetry to people who understand the trade, but you get the idea.

At the moment (with Intelli/J 13 at least) you should be able to just import the whole project with most features working as intended if you keep the following steps in mind:

* Download and install the Scala plugin (well ... duh)
* Import jbj as Maven project (well, again ... duh)
* Even though the tests can be run with JUnit you will get the best results if you run them as Spec2 tests. Unluckily you have to explicitly tell Intelli/J to do so.
